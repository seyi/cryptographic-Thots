# cryptographic-Thots
Erlang programming implementation of concepts and ideas in Cryptography. 

Also contains tools for quick display of mathematical forms on the console that may prove useful for testing of mathematical ideas and perhaps hypothesis.

Could be useful for rapid prototyping cryptographic ideas

Contains the following algorithm in pure Erlang:
- Integer Factorization
- Prime Factorization
- Perfect Power 
- Prime generation
- Test for perfect square
- Test for relative primes
- Euclid algorithm for two integers
- Euclid algorithm for multiple integers
- Least Common Multiple for two Integers
- Least common multiple for a list of integers
